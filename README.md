# cra-template-with-bootstrap
An easy-to-use boilerplate for bootstrapping with react (uses cdn...)

# why
I wanted an easy way to include bootstrap with my react projects - I realize using cdn may not be the ideal way for production, none-the-less give [this answer on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26192897/should-i-use-bootstrap-from-cdn-or-make-a-copy-on-my-server "Should I use Bootstrap from CDN or make a copy on my server?") a read - it helped me make the decision.

## what you get
a `npx create-react-app` with bootstrap cdn in the `public\index.js` file

## what you need
a supported version of node (go latest)
npm 5.2+ for that npx goodness!
a terminal :)

## how to use
`npx create-react-app my-app --template cra-template-with-bootstrap` in a terminal of your project folder

If you're not familiar with the terminal, how to use commands in it, etc - give [this article](https://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/navigating-the-terminal-a-gentle-introduction--mac-3855 "Navigating the Terminal: A Gentle Introduction") a read, I only skimmed it, but it looks comprehensive and it has top marks on Google :). Ok you might find this harsh but I struggled with using the commands for a long time, even git and it wasn't until I threw myself into it that I figured it out. I was mostly afraid that I wouldn't know the commands or how to use them; turns out Google is your friend and there is no better motivator than necessity.
